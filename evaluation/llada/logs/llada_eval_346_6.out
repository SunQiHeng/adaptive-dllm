/home/qiheng/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:61: FutureWarning: The pynvml package is deprecated. Please install nvidia-ml-py instead. If you did not install pynvml directly, please report this to the maintainers of the package that installed pynvml for you.
  import pynvml  # type: ignore[import]
The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
