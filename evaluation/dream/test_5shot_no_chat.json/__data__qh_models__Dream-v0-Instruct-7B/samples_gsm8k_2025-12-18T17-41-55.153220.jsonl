The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\nAnswer: The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240\n\nQuestion: A bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain.
